# TMX Language Conversion (en-US → en-UK)

This repository demonstrates how to modify TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) files by changing the source language code from **en-US** to **en-UK**.  
It showcases practical localization engineering skills, bilingual file handling, and QA validation for translation assets.

## 🧪 Why This Matters

Changing locale codes is a common task in:
- localization engineering  
- translation memory cleanup  
- QA validation  
- preparing bilingual files for CAT tools  
- ensuring consistency across projects  

This repo demonstrates:
- XML awareness  
- understanding of TMX structure  
- attention to detail  
- practical localization engineering skills
